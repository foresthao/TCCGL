# TCCGL: Topology Coarsening Continual Graph Learning for Network Intrusion Detection

This repository hosts the official implementation of **TCCGL**, a continual graph learning framework for network intrusion detection on streaming network-flow graphs. TCCGL combines an edge-to-node transformation with topology-preserving graph coarsening and structure-aware replay to learn new attack classes over time while mitigating catastrophic forgetting under practical memory constraints.

## Code Availability

The full source code, training scripts, and preprocessing utilities will be released **upon paper acceptance**.  
Thank you for your interest!
